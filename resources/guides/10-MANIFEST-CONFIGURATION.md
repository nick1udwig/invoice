# Skeleton App Manifest Configuration

This skeleton app includes a minimal `manifest.json` with only the essential capabilities needed for a basic Hyperware application.

## Current Configuration

- **process_name**: "skeleton-app" - Matches the package name in metadata.json
- **on_exit**: "Restart" - Automatically restarts if the app crashes (good for development)
- **request_networking**: true - Allows network requests (needed for most modern apps)
- **public**: true - Other processes can send messages to this app (required for P2P features)

## Included Capabilities

1. **homepage:homepage:sys** - Allows the app to appear on the Hyperware homepage
2. **http-server:distro:sys** - Required to serve the UI and handle API requests

## Common Capabilities to Add

When extending this skeleton, you might need to add these capabilities to `request_capabilities`:

- **http-client:distro:sys** - For making external HTTP requests
- **vfs:distro:sys** - For file system access (storing data, config files)
- **eth:distro:sys** - For Ethereum blockchain interaction
- **sqlite:distro:sys** - For local database storage
- **timer:distro:sys** - For scheduled tasks
- **terminal:terminal:sys** - For terminal output

## Important Notes

- The manifest.json is auto-generated by `kit b --hyperapp` but can be manually edited
- Always ensure process_name matches your metadata.json package name
- Add capabilities BEFORE trying to use them in code
- For production apps, consider setting "on_exit": "None" to prevent auto-restart
- See resources/guides/09-CAPABILITIES-GUIDE.md for detailed capability documentation
